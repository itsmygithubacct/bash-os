/* _git/rename.h — noticing that a file was renamed.
 *
 * A deletion and an addition in the same change are one rename when the
 * content is the same, or close enough. git measures "close enough" by
 * cutting both files into chunks — each ending at a newline, or after 64
 * bytes — and counting how many of the source's bytes survive in chunks the
 * destination also has. The score is those bytes against the larger file,
 * out of 60000, and half of that is the threshold; the percentage git
 * prints as "similarity index" is the same number out of a hundred.
