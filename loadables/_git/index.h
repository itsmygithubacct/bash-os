 *   Header: "DIRC" + version (4 bytes BE) + entry_count (4 bytes BE)
 *   N entries:
 *     ctime_sec, ctime_nsec, mtime_sec, mtime_nsec (4×4 bytes)
 *     dev, ino, mode, uid, gid, file_size                  (6×4 bytes)
 *     sha1[20]
 *     flags (2 bytes BE; low 12 = path length, capped at 0xFFF)
 *     path (NUL-terminated; total entry padded to 8-byte boundary,
 *           with at least 1 NUL pad byte)
 *   Trailer: 20-byte SHA-1 of all preceding bytes

 * v3 adds a second flags field on entries marked CE_EXTENDED. Reads accept
