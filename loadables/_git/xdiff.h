 * Myers' algorithm over lines, in the linear-space divide and conquer form,
 * with everything git does around it: the problem is cut down first, so the
 * search never sees a line that cannot be part of a match; the search gives
 * up on an exact answer where one would cost too much, as git's does; and
 * afterwards a run of changed lines is slid as far down as it can go while
 * still describing the same edit, with the indent heuristic picking the
 * position that reads best, which is what git has done by default since
 * 2.14. Hunks carry three lines of context unless asked otherwise, and two
 * changes closer than twice the context become one hunk.
