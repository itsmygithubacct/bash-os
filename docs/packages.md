# Loadable packages

A dynamic bash-os build can load a command it was built without. `pkg`
installs the command from a signed package, and `pkg load` (or `enable -f`)
makes it a builtin in the running shell.

## What a package holds

A package is an uncompressed ustar archive named `NAME_VERSION_ARCH.pkg` with
two members:

- `MANIFEST`: `name`, `type: loadable`, `version`, `builtin`, `abi: bash-5.3`,
  `arch`, the SHA-256 of the object, a description, and the mode pkg installs
  the object with;
- `loadable/NAME.so`: the builtin as a shared object.

The object needs no shared library except `libm.so.6`. pkg accepts that one
because glibc installs libm beside libc, and glibc's `libm.a` cannot be linked
into a shared object. Everything else the builtin uses is linked into the
object: helper sources, builtins it calls, static libraries from
`build-deps.sh`, and the static part of glibc. The object binds its own
symbols first, so loading it into a shell that already has a builtin of that
name replaces that builtin without mixing code from the two.

Packages load only into dynamic executables built for the same architecture,
with glibc, from the same Bash release. A static executable cannot load shared
objects at all.

## Building packages

```sh
./build.sh --profile shell       # the smallest dynamic bash: out/bash-shell
./build-deps.sh                  # static PIC zlib, PCRE2, xz, zstd and bzip2
./build-packages.sh              # every command -> out/packages/x86_64/
./build-packages.sh seq wc awk   # or only these
```

`build-packages.sh` stages sources as `build.sh` does: this repository's
loadables, Bash's example loadables with the fixups `build.sh` applies, and
the flattened helpers. It compiles them against the Bash tree the last build
left behind (`--tree`), which must come from a dynamic build for the same
target. If `./build.sh --profile shell` reports that it is up to date after a
different build has replaced the tree, add `--clean`.

An object is packed only after two gates:

1. every strong undefined symbol is defined by `out/bash-shell` (`--bash`), by
   a library it needs, or by its program interpreter. Checking against the
   smallest build means a package that passes loads into every dynamic
   profile;
2. that bash loads the object with `enable -f`, and `type -t` reports a
   builtin.

A source that defines no `NAME_struct` (`wc.c`, for one, registers
`bashwc_struct`) gets the entry that `build.sh`'s builtin table gives it: its
`NAME_builtin`, its `NAME_doc`, and the short help from
`config/bash-loadables.list`.

The output directory receives the packages, an unsigned `INDEX` with one
`pkg-loadable-v1` record per package, and `build-report.tsv` with each
command's object size or failure reason. The exit status is 1 if any command
failed. The version defaults to the date of the HEAD commit; `--version`
overrides it. With the same sources, compiler and version, the packages and
the INDEX are identical byte for byte.

For another architecture, set `CC` as for `build.sh`, and pass `--runner` with
a command that runs the target's executables, such as qemu-user with the
target's library directory.

## Signing a release

```sh
./sign-packages.sh keygen ~/keys bash-os-2026    # once: .pub and .sec
./sign-packages.sh release --key ~/keys/bash-os-2026.sec \
  --out out/release out/packages/x86_64 out/packages/aarch64
```

Keys are in signify format. The secret key has no passphrase and is written
with mode 0600, so keep it on the machine that signs, never in a repository or
a CI secret. `release` checks every package against the SHA-256 in its INDEX,
then fills a new directory with:

- each package and its signature, `NAME_VERSION_ARCH.pkg.sig`;
- one `INDEX` covering every architecture, and `INDEX.sig`;
- `SHA256SUMS`.

Nothing is nested, so the directory can be uploaded as the assets of one
GitHub release.

## Installing

A system trusts a publisher when its `.pub` file is in
`/etc/bashsignify/trusted` (or `$BASHSIGNIFY_TRUSTED_KEYS_DIR`). Key numbers
listed in `/etc/bashsignify/revoked-keys` are refused. Put the release URL in
`/etc/pkg/sources.list`, then:

```sh
pkg update --remote    # fetch the INDEX and check INDEX.sig
pkg install awk        # fetch the package and check its signature and object
pkg load awk           # enable it in this shell
```

`https://` sources need `--remote`, and `http://` sources need
`--remote-insecure`. A line in `sources.list` may instead begin with `remote`
or `remote-insecure`.

## Tests

`tests/packages.py` builds ten packages twice and compares the bytes, checks
that the producer and the signer refuse bad input, serves a signed release
over HTTP, and installs every package with an empty `PATH`. It then runs each
builtin in `out/bash-shell` and compares the output with the same builtin
compiled into `out/bash`. `tests/pkg-signify.py` covers pkg's signature,
trust, revocation and dependency checks. `tests/run.sh` runs both.
